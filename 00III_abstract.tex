Quasi two-dimensional Coulomb systems are of fundamental importance and have attracted much attention in many areas nowadays.
Their reduced symmetry and the long range nature of the Coulomb interaction give rise to interesting collective behaviors, but also brings great challenges for particle-based simulations, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
In this thesis, we propose a set of algorithms to address the challenges, by combining the Ewald summation with the recent proposed random batch sampling method.
