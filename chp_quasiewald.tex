\section{The Quasi-Ewald Method}

In this section, we present quasi-Ewald splitting, a novel decomposition strategy tailored for quasi-2D systems with dielectric mismatches. By integrating this approach with random batch sampling, we develop an efficient summation method that achieves linear complexity.

\subsection{Quasi-Ewald splitting and Green's Function in the Reciprocal Space}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Firstly, given a fixed point  $\V{r}^\prime=(x^{\prime}, y^{\prime},z^{\prime})$, we decompose   the Dirac delta function into
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}\label{eq...text...Quasi-EwaldMethod...QuasiEwaldSplitting}
\begin{aligned}
    \delta(\V{r}-\V{r}^\prime) &= \left[\delta (\V{r}-\V{r}^\prime) - {\left( \frac{\alpha}{\pi} \right)} \exp{\left(-\alpha \Norm{\vrho-\vrho^\prime}^2\right)} \delta(z-z^\prime) \right]\\&~~ + {\left( \frac{\alpha}{\pi} \right)} \exp{\left(-\alpha \Norm{\vrho-\vrho^\prime}^2\right)} \delta(z-z^\prime)\;,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $\vr:=(\vrho, z):=(x,y,z)$,   $\vrho:=(x,y)$, and $\vrho^\prime:=(x^\prime,y^\prime)$.
 In this formulation, the first term represents  a charge neutral short range kernel centered at $\vr^\prime$, and the second term corresponds to a smooth long range kernel.  We further define  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}\label{eq...text...Kernels}
    \begin{split}
        \sigma_{s}(\V{r}; \vr^\prime) &:= \delta (\V{r}-\V{r}^\prime) - {\left( \frac{\alpha}{\pi} \right)} \exp{\left(-\alpha \Norm{\vrho-\vrho^\prime}^2\right)} \delta(z-z^\prime)\;,\\
        \sigma_{l}(\V{r};\vr^\prime) &:= {\left( \frac{\alpha}{\pi} \right)} \exp{\left(-\alpha \Norm{\vrho-\vrho^\prime}^2\right)} \delta(z-z^\prime)\;,
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  Consequently, the total charge density in the system can be expressed as 
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{equation}
%     \sigma(\vr) = \sum_{\V{m}} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} q_i \left[\sigma_{s}(\V{r} - \V{r}_i + \V{L_m})  +  \sigma_{s}(\V{r} - \V{r}_i + \V{L_m})\right]\;,
% \end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and  depiction of the decomposition process is provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:QuasiEwaldSplitting}.

        An illustration for the Quasi-Ewald splitting strategy in a unit cell.
        (a) Charged particles are distributed in the simulation box, cations and anions are represented by red and blue spheres, respectively.
        Sub-figures (b) and (c) shows how Quasi-Ewald splitting works. 
        The discs represent 2D Gaussian charge planes which screen the original point charges.
        We split the original problem into two sub-problems, one with charge neutral particles so that the interactions are short-ranged, another with smooth charge density with a proper geometry so that can be solved rapidly in the reciprocal space.

Throughout this paper, we will extensively use 2D-Fourier transforms, whose definition is given by
\begin{defi}
Given function $f(\vrho, z)$, its 2D-Fourier
transform is defined by
  \begin{equation} 
\Hat{f}(\vk, z):=\int_{\sR^2}f(\vrho,z)\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho})} \D \vrho \;.
\end{equation}
The function  $f(\vrho, z)$ can be  recovered from the corresponding inverse 2D-Fourier transform
  \begin{equation} 
{f}(\vrho, z)=\frac{1}{4\pi^2}\int_{\sR^2}\Hat{f}(\vk, z)\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho})} \D \vk \;.
\end{equation}
\end{defi} 
% \begin{equation}\label{eq...text...FourierTransformKernels}
%     \begin{split}   
%  \hat{\sigma}_{s}(\vk,z) &=\delta(z)\left[1-\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\right]\;,\\
%  \hat{\sigma}_{l}(\vk,z) &=\delta(z)\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\;.

\begin{prop}
Given  fixed point     $\V{r}^\prime=(x^{\prime}, y^{\prime},z^{\prime})$,    non-zero modes of the 2D-Fourier
transform  of  $ \sigma_{s}(\V{r};\vr^\prime)$ and   $\sigma_{l}(\V{r};\vr^\prime)$  respectively reads
\begin{align*}
 \Hat{\sigma}_{s}(\vk,z;z^\prime) &= \delta(z-z^\prime) \exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}^\prime)}\left(1-\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\right)\;,  \\
 \Hat{\sigma}_{l}(\vk,z;z^\prime) &= \delta(z-z^\prime) \exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}^\prime)}\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\;,
\end{align*}   
where $\vk\neq\vzero$, and the zeroth mode reads
\begin{align*}
 \Hat{\sigma}_{s}(\vzero,z;z^\prime) &= 0\;,  \\
 \Hat{\sigma}_{l}(\vzero,z;z^\prime) &= \delta(z-z^\prime)\;.
\end{align*}   
\end{prop}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{proof}
We observe that for $\vk\neq\vzero$, the following integral reads %the  2D-Fourier transform  of $ \sigma_{s}(\V{r}-\vr^\prime)$ reads
\begin{align*}
  % \Hat{\sigma}_{s}(\vk,z-z^\prime) &=    \int_{\sR^2}\sigma_{s}(\V{r}-\vr^\prime)\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho})} \D \vrho \\
  % &= \delta(z-z^\prime)\left(
 & \int_{\sR^2}\left[\delta(\vrho-\vrho^\prime)- {\left( \frac{\alpha}{\pi} \right)} \exp{\left(-\alpha \Norm{\vrho-\vrho^\prime}^2\right)}\right] \exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho})} \D \vrho \\
 =&\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}^\prime)}\left[1-  \int_{\sR^2}{\left( \frac{\alpha}{\pi} \right)} \exp{\left(-\alpha \Norm{\vrho-\vrho^\prime}^2\right)}  \exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot (\V{\rho}-\vrho^\prime))} \D \vrho\right]\\
 =&\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}^\prime)}\left(1-\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\right)\;,
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
hence we obtain that 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
 \Hat{\sigma}_{s}(\vk,z;z^\prime) &= \delta(z-z^\prime) \exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}^\prime)}\left(1-\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\right)\;,  \\
 \Hat{\sigma}_{l}(\vk,z;z^\prime) &= \delta(z-z^\prime) \exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}^\prime)}\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\;.
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We observe further that the following integral reads
\begin{align*}
  % \Hat{\sigma}_{s}(\vk,z-z^\prime) &=    \int_{\sR^2}\sigma_{s}(\V{r}-\vr^\prime)\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho})} \D \vrho \\
  % &= \delta(z-z^\prime)\left(
 & \int_{\sR^2}\left[\delta(\vrho-\vrho^\prime)- {\left( \frac{\alpha}{\pi} \right)} \exp{\left(-\alpha \Norm{\vrho-\vrho^\prime}^2\right)}\right]  \D \vrho \\
 =&\int_{\sR^2}\left[\delta(\vrho-\vrho^\prime)- {\left( \frac{\alpha}{\pi} \right)} \exp{\left(-\alpha \Norm{\vrho-\vrho^\prime}^2\right)}\right]  \D \left(\vrho-\vrho^\prime\right) =0\;,
\end{align*}
which finishes the proof.

Given $\vr_0:=(\vrho_0,z_0):=(x_0, y_0, z_0)\in\Omega_{\mrm{c}}$,  then the   Poisson's equation reads

hence the boundary condition can be  simplified into

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Finally, for $z\in[0, z_0]$, $\Hat{G}_{\mrm{c}}(\vk, z; z_0)$ takes the form

\begin{rmk}\label{Remark...Nonzero+larger}
 The condition $\gamma_u \gamma_d < 1$ and $k > 0$ guarantees that the determinant  of the Eqn. \eqref{proof...Matrix} is non-zero, hence $A,B,E,F$ admit  unique solutions. Moreover, it is noteworthy that all  the components in $a_{1:4}(z;z_0)$ take positive values. 
\end{rmk}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Based on the decomposition relation \eqref{eq...text...Quasi-EwaldMethod...QuasiEwaldSplitting} and definition in Eqn. \eqref{eq...text...Kernels}, we observe that 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}%\label{eq...text...Rewrite-in-kernels}
   \delta(\V{r}-\V{r}_0)=\sigma_s  (\V{r};\V{r}_0)+\sigma_l  (\V{r};\V{r}_0)\;,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and we  shall decompose the Green's function  $ G(\V{r}, \V{r_0})$ correspondingly into
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
    G(\V{r}, \V{r_0})= G_s(\V{r}, \V{r_0})+ G_l(\V{r}, \V{r_0})\;,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $ G_s(\V{r}, \V{r_0})$ and $ G_l(\V{r}, \V{r_0})$ are the solutions to the   Poisson's equation \eqref{eq...text...RepPoisson}  except that $\delta(\V{r}-\V{r}_0)$ is replaced respectively by $\sigma_s  (\V{r};\V{r}_0)$ and $\sigma_l  (\V{r};\V{r}_0)$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{corollary}
For any $\vk\neq \vzero$, given     $\hat{G}(\vk, z; z_0)$, we obtain that  
    \begin{align*}
        \hat{G}_s(\vk, z; z_0)&=\hat{G}(\vk, z; z_0)\left[1-\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\right]\;,\\
        \hat{G}_l(\vk, z; z_0)&=\hat{G}(\vk, z; z_0)\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\;,
    \end{align*} 
    and for  $\vk=\vzero$, given     $\hat{G}(\vzero, z; z_0)$, we obtain that  
        \begin{align*}
        \hat{G}_s(\vzero, z; z_0)&=0\;,\\
        \hat{G}_l(\vzero, z; z_0)&=\hat{G}(\vzero, z; z_0)\;.
    \end{align*} 
\end{corollary}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Its proof is straightforward in that we only need to solve out the Systems of Eq.~\eqref{proof...Matrix} by replacing  the coefficient $-\frac{\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_0)}}{k\epsilon_{\mrm{c}}}$ with  
\begin{equation*}
    -\frac{\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_0)}}{k\epsilon_{\mrm{c}}}\left[1-\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\right]\;,
\end{equation*}
and 
\begin{equation*}
    -\frac{\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_0)}}{k\epsilon_{\mrm{c}}}\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\;,
\end{equation*} 
respectively.
Consequently, the Green's function $ G_s(\V{r}, \V{r_0})$ and $ G_l(\V{r}, \V{r_0})$ can be recovered following the inverse Fourier transform of $  \hat{G}_s(\vk, z; z_0)$ and $  \hat{G}_l(\vk, z; z_0)$,
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
 G_s(\V{r}, \V{r_0})&=   \frac{1}{4\pi^2}\int_{\sR^2} \hat{G}_s(\vk, z; z_0)\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho})} \D \vk\\
 &= \frac{1}{4\pi^2}\int_{\sR^2} \hat{G}(\vk, z; z_0)\left[1-\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\right]\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho})} \D \vk\;,\\
 G_l(\V{r}, \V{r_0})&=   \frac{1}{4\pi^2}\int_{\sR^2} \hat{G}_l(\vk, z; z_0)\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho})} \D \vk\\
 &= \frac{1}{4\pi^2}\int_{\sR^2} \hat{G}(\vk, z; z_0)\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho})} \D \vk\;.
\end{aligned}    
\end{equation*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Hence the total interaction energy reads
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
   U & =   U_s+U_l\;,
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
whereas
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align}
U_s&:=    \frac{1}{2} {\sum_{\V{m}}}^\prime \sum_{i, j = 1}^{N} q_i q_j G_s(\V{r}_i+\vL_m, \V{r}_j)\;, \label{eq::U_s}\\

\end{align}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Given $\vr_j:=(\vrho_j, z_j)$, then for the short range kernel $G_s(\cdot, \V{r}_j)$, whose expression reads 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
 &G_s(\V{r}, \V{r}_j)\\
 =&   \frac{1}{4\pi^2}\int_{\sR^2} \hat{G}(\vk, z; z_j)\left[1-\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\right]\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho})} \D \vk\\

\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
moreover, if further given $\V{r}_i:=(\vrho_i, z_i)$, we obtain that 
\begin{align*}
   &G_s(\V{r}_i, \V{r}_j)\\
   =& \frac{1}{8\pi^2\epsilon_{\mrm{c}}}\int_{\sR^2} \frac{ \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}}{k\left(1-\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\exp(-2kL_z)\right)} \left[1-\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\right]\left[\sum_{p=1}^4\Gamma_p\exp(-ka_p(z_i;z_j))\right]\D \vk\;,
\end{align*}
where $\V{\rho}_{ij}:=\vrho_i-\vrho_j$. 
In actually calculations, due to the short range nature of~$G_s(\cdot, \V{r}_j)$, the infinite sum in Eq.~\eqref{eq::U_s} is truncated to a finite sum in real space with a cutoff $r_c$, given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq::U_s_truncated}
    U_s \approx U_{s, *} = \sum_{\abs{\bm{\rho}_{ij, m}} \leq r_c} q_i q_j G_s(\V{r}_i+\vL_m, \V{r}_j)\;,
\end{equation}
where $\bm{\rho}_{ij, m}:=\vrho_i-\vrho_j+ (L_x m_x, L_y m_y)$, and the summation indicates that among all possible pairs of particles, only the terms with $\abs{\bm{\rho}_{ij, m}} \leq r_c$ are considered.


 As for the long  range kernel $G_l(\cdot, \V{r}_j)$, based on the Poisson summation formula, we obtain that 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{align*}

% \end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}\label{eq...text...PoissonSummation}
 \sum_{\vm} G_l(\V{r}+\vL_m, \V{r}_j)  =\frac{1}{ L_xL_y}   \sum_{\vk\in\fK^2} \Hat{G}_l(\vk,z;z_j)\exp(\textrm{i}\vk\cdot \vrho) \;,

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where \[\fK^2 := \left\{\vk \in \frac{  2\pi}{L_x}\sZ\times \frac{  2\pi}{L_y}\sZ \right\}\;.\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Furthermore, the RHS of Eqn. \eqref{eq...text...PoissonSummation} reads
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
&\frac{1}{ L_xL_y}   \sum_{\vk\in\fK^2} \Hat{G}_l(\vk,z;z_j)\exp(\textrm{i}\vk\cdot \vrho)\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
therefore, given $\vr_i$, the above expression can be simplified into

to sum up, the energy $U_l$ reads

where $\rho_{ij}:=\Norm{\vrho_{ij}}=\Norm{\vrho_i-\vrho_j}$, and $\fJ_0(\cdot)$ is the zeroth-order Bessel function,  which  can   be expressed as a complex contour integral over a full period.

\begin{defi}
    The zeroth-order Bessel function of the first kind, denoted by $\fJ_0(r)$, is formally defined via the integral representation

    \end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\end{defi}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We proceed to evaluate the following integral
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}\label{eq...text...InfiniteIntegral}
\int_0^{+\infty} \frac{ \exp(-ak)}{1-\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\exp(-2kL_z)} \left[1-\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\right]\fJ_0(\rho k)\D k\;,    
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $a>0$ and $\rho>0$ are fixed constants. Firstly, we observe that Eqn. \eqref{eq...text...InfiniteIntegral} can be written into
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
   & \int_0^{+\infty} \frac{ \exp(-ak)}{1-\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\exp(-2kL_z)} \left[1-\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\right]\fJ_0(\rho k)\D k\\

\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Secondly, we observe further that Term $\mathrm{I}$ can be decomposed into
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
&\int_0^{+\infty} \frac{1}{1-\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\exp(-2kL_z)}  \exp(-ak) \fJ_0(\rho k)\D k\\

then Term $\mathrm{I(a)}$ can be simplified into

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
It is observed that Term $\mathrm{I(b)}$ and Term $\mathrm{II}$  comprise infinite integrals involving rapidly decaying functions coupled with oscillatory components. To efficiently evaluate such integrals over an infinite domain, we employ the method proposed in \cite{trefethen2022exactness}, which facilitates numerical computation by truncating the integration region to a finite domain. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{thm}[Theorem 5.1 in \cite{trefethen2022exactness}]\label{Thm...Truncation}
%  Let $f(x)$ be analytic and bounded for $x \in(-\infty, \infty)$, and suppose $F(x):=\exp \left(-x^2\right) f(x)$ extends to a bounded analytic function in the infinite strip $-a<\operatorname{Im} x<$ a for some $a>0$. Let $L>0$ be fixed, and for each $n \geq 1$, as we denote  \[I_n(F):=\sum_{j=1}^n w_jF(x_j)\;,\] as the estimate of the integral \[I(F):=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} F(x)\D x \;,\]  obtained by applying Gauss-Legendre, Clenshaw-Curtis, or equispaced trapezoidal quadrature on the truncated interval $\left[-L n^{1 / 3}, L n^{1 / 3}\right]$. Then for some $C>0$,  the following holds 
%  \begin{equation}
%  \left|I-I_n\right|=\fO\left(\exp \left(-C n^{2 / 3}\right)\right), \quad n \rightarrow \infty\;.  
%  \end{equation}
% \end{thm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
For any given 
$M>0$, as the infinite integral can be decomposed into
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation*}
 \int_0^{+\infty} F(k)\D  k=  \int_0^{M} F(k)\D  k+\int_M^{+\infty} F(k)\D  k\;,
\end{equation*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
then the first part of the integral can be efficiently evaluated  using  Gauss-Legendre quadrature, while the second integral can be neglected for sufficiently large $M$. To ensure   validity of such truncation, it is necessary to provide some  estimates on the associated truncation error as a function of $M$.
% For the Term $\mathrm{I(b)}$, its truncation error reads
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Efficient Calculation of  Long Range Interaction Energy}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As the long range interaction  energy $U_l$ reads
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*} 
U_l&=\frac{1}{4\epsilon_{\mrm{c}} L_xL_y}\sum_{i,j=1}^N q_iq_j\Bigg({\Abs{z_i-z_j}} +\\&~~~~+  \sum_{\vk\in\fK^2,\vk\neq\vzero} \frac{ \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}}{k\left(1-\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\exp(-2kL_z)\right)}\left[\sum_{p=1}^4\Gamma_p\exp(-ka_p(z_i;z_j))\right] \exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\Bigg)\;,
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and we endeavor to  reduce the $\fO(N^2)$ complexity to linear scaling by incorporating the idea of random batch sampling in combination with some alignment techniques.

%Firstly, we shall deal with the summation over $i$ and $j$, i.e., $\sum_{i,j=1}^N$. 
We observe that the four components in the following summation read
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
     &\sum_{p=1}^4\Gamma_p\exp(-ka_p(z_i;z_j))\\  
     =&\exp(-k\Abs{z_i-z_j})+\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\exp(-k(z_i+z_j))\\
     &+\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\exp(-k(2L_z-z_i-z_j)) +\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\exp(-k(2L_z-\Abs{z_i-z_j}))\;.
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To facilitate the computation, we define auxiliary functions   $h_{1:4}(k)$ as 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
 h_1(\vk)&:= \frac{1}{4\epsilon_{\mrm{c}} L_xL_yk\left(1-\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\exp(-2kL_z)\right)} \;,\\
  h_2(\vk)&:= \frac{\gamma_{\mrm{d}}}{4\epsilon_{\mrm{c}} L_xL_yk\left(1-\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\exp(-2kL_z)\right)} \;,\\
   h_3(\vk)&:= \frac{\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\exp(-2kL_z)}{4\epsilon_{\mrm{c}} L_xL_yk\left(1-\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\exp(-2kL_z)\right)}\;,\\
     h_4(\vk)&:= \frac{\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\exp(-2kL_z)}{4\epsilon_{\mrm{c}} L_xL_yk\left(1-\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\exp(-2kL_z)\right)}\;,
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and another set of auxiliary functions   $S_{0:4}(k)$ as
%which allows us to express the summation over $i$ and $j$ in  $U_l$ as
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*} 
S_0&:=\frac{1}{4\epsilon_{\mrm{c}} L_xL_y}\sum_{i,j=1}^Nq_iq_j {\Abs{z_i-z_j}}\;,\\
S_1(\vk)&:=\sum_{i,j=1}^Nq_iq_j  \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(-k\Abs{z_i-z_j})\;,\\
S_2(\vk)&:=\sum_{i,j=1}^Nq_iq_j  \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(-k(z_i+z_j))\;,\\
S_3(\vk)&:=\sum_{i,j=1}^Nq_iq_j  \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(k(z_i+z_j))\;,\\
S_4(\vk)&:=\sum_{i,j=1}^Nq_iq_j \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(k\Abs{z_i-z_j})\;.
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Consequently, the long-range interaction energy   $U_l$ reads
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}\label{eq...text...Energy}
U_l =    S_0+ \sum_{\vk\in\fK^2,\vk\neq\vzero} \exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\sum_{p=1}^4S_p(\vk)h_p(\vk)\;.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and for simplicity, we denote hereafter in this paper that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq...text...phi}
    \phi(\vk):=\sum_{p=1}^4S_p(\vk)h_p(\vk)\;,
\end{equation}
and on the basis of Eqn. \eqref{eq...text...phi}, the   energy   $U_l$ can be simplified into 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eq...text...EnergywithPhi}
U_l =    S_0+ \sum_{\vk\in\fK^2,\vk\neq\vzero} \phi(\vk)\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right) \;,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and the idea of random batch sampling is employed to efficiently evaluate the summation over   $\vk$, i.e., $\sum_{\vk\in\fK^2,\vk\neq\vzero}$. 
%However, prior to this step, we shall  introduce some alignment techniques to further enhance computational efficiency.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Part One: Pairwise Summation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
It is easy to observe that  the  auxiliary functions  $S_2(\vk)$ and $S_3(\vk)$ are multiplicatively separable  in the sense that  they can be written into
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
S_2(\vk)&=\sum_{i,j=1}^Nq_iq_j  \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(-k(z_i+z_j))\\
&=\left(\sum_{i=1}^Nq_i\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{i})}\exp(-kz_i)\right)\left(\sum_{j=1}^Nq_j\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{j})}\exp(-kz_j)\right)\;,\\
S_3(\vk)&=\sum_{i,j=1}^Nq_iq_j  \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(k(z_i+z_j))\\
&=\left(\sum_{i=1}^Nq_i  \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{i})}\exp(kz_i)\right)\left(\sum_{j=1}^Nq_j  \exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{j})}\exp(kz_j)\right)\;,
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
such factorization significantly reduces computational complexity, as the direct evaluation of the double summation requires 
$\fO(N^2)$ operations, whereas the factorized form allows computation in only 
$\fO(N)$ steps.

However, the functions $S_0$,  $S_1(\vk)$ and $S_4(\vk)$  are non-multiplicatively separable due to the presence of the absolute difference term $\abs{z_i - z_j}$ which prevents direct factorization. Consequently, the strategy employed for 
$S_2(\vk)$ and $S_3(\vk)$ is no longer applicable. To achieve linear computational complexity in evaluating these terms,  some specialized alignment techniques must be introduced.

Firstly, we sort all $N$ particles according to their positions along the 
$z$-axis, ensuring the ordering
\begin{equation*}
   0 < z_1 < z_2 <  \cdots <  z_{N - 1}<z_N < L_z\;.
\end{equation*}
Since for all  $i$, $z_i \in (0, L_z)$ is uniformly bounded, hence  the strategies such as the bucket sorting~\cite{corwin2004sorting} can be applied, and the computational cost can be of order~$\mathcal{O}(N \log{N})$ or even  of order~$\mathcal{O}(N)$. Once all $N$ particles are sorted according to their positions along the 
$z$-axis, we observe that $S_0$ can be written into
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
    S_0 
    & = \sum_{i = 1}^N q_i \left( \sum_{j = 1}^{i }{q_j (z_i - z_j)} \right) \\
    & = 2 \sum_{i = 1}^N q_i \left( z_i \sum_{j = 1}^{i }q_j - \sum_{j = 1}^{i }z_j q_j  \right) \;.
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To efficiently compute this summation, we introduce two auxiliary sequences  $\left\{T_1(i)\right\}_{i=1}^N$ and $\left\{T_2(i)\right\}_{i=1}^N$, both of which  can be iteratively updated as follows:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
    &T_1(1)=q_1,~~T_1(i+1)=T_1(i)+q_{i+1}\;,\\
    &T_2(1)=z_1q_1,~~T_2(i+1)=T_2(i)+z_{i+1}q_{i+1}\;.
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Using these auxiliary sequences, 
$S_0$ can be efficiently calculated as
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
S_0= 2 \sum_{i = 1}^N q_i \left( z_iT_1(i)-T_2(i)\right)\;,
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
which requires only 
$4N$ operations, significantly reducing computational complexity in comparison with the naive summation.

A similar strategy~\cite{jiang2021approximating, gan2024fast} can also be applied to the evaluation of $S_1(\vk)$ and $S_4(\vk)$. For $S_1(\vk)$, we obtain that 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
S_1(\vk)&=\sum_{i,j=1}^Nq_iq_j  \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(-k\Abs{z_i-z_j})\\
&=-\sum_{i=1}^Nq_i^2+\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^iq_iq_j  \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(-k(z_i-z_j))\\
&~~+\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=i}^Nq_iq_j  \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(-k(z_j-z_i))\\
&= -\sum_{i=1}^Nq_i^2+\sum_{i=1}^N q_i\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{i})}\exp(-kz_i)\sum_{j=1}^iq_j\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{j})}\exp(kz_j)\\
&~~+\sum_{i=1}^N q_i\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{i})}\exp(kz_i)\sum_{j=i}^Nq_j\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{j})}\exp(-kz_j)\;,
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 we introduce another two auxiliary sequences  $\left\{T_3(i)\right\}_{i=1}^N$ and $\left\{T_4(i)\right\}_{i=1}^N$, and it is noteworthy that $\left\{T_3(i)\right\}_{i=1}^N$ is  constructed through forward iteration, whereas  $\left\{T_4(i)\right\}_{i=1}^N$   is generated through backward iteration:
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
    &T_3(1)=q_1\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{1})}\exp(kz_1)\;,\\
    &T_3(i+1)=T_3(i)+q_{i+1}\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{i+1})}\exp(kz_{i+1})\;,\\
    &T_4(N)=q_N\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{N})}\exp(-kz_N)\;,\\
    &T_4(i-1)=T_4(i)+q_{i-1}\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{i-1})}\exp(-kz_{i-1})\;,
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and
$S_1(\vk)$ can be efficiently calculated as
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
S_1(\vk)= -\sum_{i=1}^Nq_i^2+ \sum_{i=1}^N q_i\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{i})}\left[\exp(-kz_i)T_3(i)+\exp(kz_i)T_4(i)\right]\;.
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As for $S_4(\vk)$, we shall follow the same routine:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
S_4(\vk)&=\sum_{i,j=1}^Nq_iq_j  \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(-k\Abs{z_i-z_j})\\
&=-\sum_{i=1}^Nq_i^2+\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^iq_iq_j  \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(k(z_i-z_j))\\
&~~+\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=i}^Nq_iq_j  \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(k(z_j-z_i))\\
&= -\sum_{i=1}^Nq_i^2+\sum_{i=1}^N q_i\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{i})}\exp(kz_i)\sum_{j=1}^iq_j\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{j})}\exp(-kz_j)\\
&~~+\sum_{i=1}^N q_i\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{i})}\exp(-kz_i)\sum_{j=i}^Nq_j\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{j})}\exp(kz_j)\;,
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and we introduce another two auxiliary sequences  $\left\{T_5(i)\right\}_{i=1}^N$ and $\left\{T_6(i)\right\}_{i=1}^N$, and it is noteworthy that $\left\{T_5(i)\right\}_{i=1}^N$ is  constructed through forward iteration, whereas  $\left\{T_6(i)\right\}_{i=1}^N$   is generated through backward iteration:
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
    &T_5(1)=q_1\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{1})}\exp(-kz_1)\;,\\
    &T_5(i+1)=T_5(i)+q_{i+1}\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{i+1})}\exp(-kz_{i+1})\;,\\
    &T_6(N)=q_N\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{N})}\exp(kz_N)\;,\\
    &T_6(i-1)=T_6(i)+q_{i-1}\exp{(-\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{i-1})}\exp(kz_{i-1})\;,
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and $S_4(\vk)$ can be written as
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
S_4(\vk)= -\sum_{i=1}^Nq_i^2+ \sum_{i=1}^N q_i\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{i})}\left[\exp(kz_i)T_5(i)+\exp(-kz_i)T_6(i)\right]\;.
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To sum up, given fixed frequency $\vk^\ast$, it only takes  linear complexity to evaluate $S_0$ and $\phi(\vk^\ast)$, and we proceed to deal with the   summation over $\vk$. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Part Two: Random Batch Importance Sampling}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, we shall introduce a stochastic algorithm designed to accelerate the Quasi-Ewald method in particle simulations, reducing the complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N)$. 
Unlike existing methods relying on either FFT or FMM-based techniques to reduce the complexity, our idea involves adopting mini-batch stochastic approximation over Fourier modes, with importance sampling for variance reduction. 
More precisely, let us consider the Fourier sum over $\bm k \in \mathcal{K}^2$ for a given kernel $f(\bm{k})$,
one can alternatively understand the Fourier sum as an expectation
\begin{equation}
	\mu:=\sum_{\bm{k}\in\mathcal{K}^2}\frac{f(\bm{k})}{g(\bm{k})}g(\bm{k})=\mathbb{E}_{\bm k\sim g(\bm{k})}\left[\frac{f(\bm{k})}{g(\bm{k})}\right],
\end{equation}
where $g(\bm{k})$ is a probability measure defined on the lattice $\bm k \in \mathcal{K}^2$ and the expectation~$\mathbb{E}_{\bm k\sim g(\bm{k})}$ is taken with respect to the probability measure.
Instead of calculating the summation directly or using FFT, a mini-batch of Fourier modes (with batch size $P$) sampled from $g(\bm{k})$ are employed to estimate the expectation, resulting in an efficient stochastic algorithm.

It is worth noting that the random mini-batch strategy originated from stochastic gradient descent in machine learning and was first introduced in the study of interacting particle systems by Jin et al.~\cite{jin2020random}, called the random batch method. Consequently
on the basis of Eqn. \eqref{eq...text...Energy},  we observe that 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
U_l =   S_0+ \sum_{\vk\in\fK^2,\vk\neq\vzero}\phi(\vk) \exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right) \;,
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
we define 
\begin{equation}\label{eq::U_l0_Ulk}
    U_l^{\vzero} := S_0,\quad\text{and}\quad U_l^{\vk\neq \vzero} :=\sum_{\vk\in\fK^2,\vk\neq\vzero}\phi(\vk) \exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right) \;,
\end{equation}
then $U_l$ can be written into the sum of these two components
\[
U_l= U_l^{\vzero}+U_l^{\vk\neq \vzero}\;,
\]
Since 
$ U_l^{\vzero}$
can be computed with linear complexity, we focus on the efficient evaluation of 
$U_l^{\vk\neq \vzero}$, for which the idea of random batch is employed.
Based on the above expression, we find a Gaussian decay factor in $U_l^{\vk\neq \vzero}$ explicitly, which can be normalized for the  purpose of importance sampling, so that we take
\begin{equation}\label{eq::hk}
	g(\bm{k}) := \frac{1}{H} \exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\;, %\quad H := \sum_{\bm{k}\neq\bm{0}}e^{-k^2/(4\alpha^2)},
\end{equation}
where \[H:= \sum_{\vk\in\fK^2,\vk\neq\vzero}\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\;,\] serves as a normalization factor.
% By application of the Poisson summation formula, $H$ can be computed as follows
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{align*}
%   H+1&=  \sum_{\vk\in\fK^2}\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)\;,\\
%   \sum_{\vk\in\fK^2}\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha}\right)&= \frac{\alpha L_xL_y}{\pi}\sum_{m_x,m_y\in\mathbb{Z}}\exp\left({-\alpha\left(m_x^2L_x^2+m_y^2L_y^2\right)}\right)\;,
% \end{align*}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% hence
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{equation}\label{eq::Happ}
% 	H=-1+\frac{\alpha L_xL_y}{\pi}\sum_{m_x,m_y\in\mathbb{Z}}\exp\left({-\alpha\left(m_x^2L_x^2+m_y^2L_y^2\right)}\right)\;,
% \end{equation}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Using the Metropolis algorithm~\cite{metropolis1953equation}, a random mini-batch of frequencies $\{\bm{k}_{\eta}\}_{\eta=1}^P$ is sampled, where~$P$ is the batch size, and $U_l$ can be approximated as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq::RBapp}
 U_l^{\vk\neq \vzero} \approx U_{l,\ast}^{\vk\neq \vzero}  :=   \frac{H}{P}\sum_{\eta=1}^P \phi(\vk_{\eta})=  \frac{H}{P}\sum_{\eta=1}^P \sum_{q=1}^4S_q(\vk_{\eta})h_q(\vk_{\eta})\;,
\end{equation} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and the corresponding estimator of the force in Fourier space is given by
\begin{equation}
	 \bm{F}_{l,i}\approx\bm{F}_{l,i}^*=-  \grad_{\V{r}_i} U_l^{\vzero}- \grad_{\V{r}_i} U_{l,\ast}^{\vk\neq \vzero}\;,
 \end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Finally, combining all these strategies, we state our Quasi-Ewald method for calculating the electrostatic energy and forces in molecular dynamics simulations, see Algorithm~\ref{alg:rbqe}.

\subsection{Consistency and Variance Analysis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section, we provide theoretical analysis for the Quasi-Ewald method. We start with considering the fluctuations, i.e., the stochastic error introduced by the importance sampling at each time step.
The fluctuations for the Fourier space components of   the force acting on the $i$th particle are defined as follows 
\begin{equation}\label{eq::xichi}
%	\Xi :=U_{l,\ast}^{\vk\neq \vzero}-U_l^{\vk\neq \vzero},\quad\text{and}\quad
    \V{\chi}_{i} :=\vF_{l,i}^*-\vF_{l,i}=\grad_{\V{r}_i} U_{l,\ast}^{\vk\neq \vzero}-\grad_{\V{r}_i} U_{l}^{\vk\neq \vzero}\;.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Proposition~\ref{prop:unbaised} is obtained directly by the definition of the importance sampling.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{prop}\label{prop:unbaised}
	  $\vF_{l,i}^*$ is a  unbiased estimator, i.e.,  $\mathbb{E} \V{\chi}_{i} = \bm 0$, and its variance  can be expressed by
% \begin{align*}
% 		\mathbb{E}\Xi^2&=\frac{H}{P}\sum_{\bm{k}_1\in\fK^2, \bm{k}_1\neq \vzero}\exp\left(-\frac{\Norm{\vk_1}^2}{4\alpha}\right)\Abs{\phi(\vk_1)-\frac{1}{H} \sum_{\bm{k}_2\in\fK^2, \bm{k}_2\neq \vzero}\phi(\vk_2)\exp\left(-\frac{\Norm{\vk_2}^2}{4\alpha}\right)}^2\;,
%         % \\
%         % \Bigg|\sum_{q=1}^4S_q(\vk_{1})h_q(\vk_{1})\\
%         % &~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-\frac{1}{H} \sum_{\bm{k}_2\neq \vzero}\exp\left(-\frac{\Norm{\vk_2}^2}{4\alpha}\right)\sum_{q=1}^4S_q(\vk_{2})h_q(\vk_{2}) \Bigg|^2\;,
% \end{align*}
% 	and
\begin{align*}
		\mathbb{E}\Norm{\V{\chi}_{i}}^2&=\frac{H}{P}\sum_{\bm{k}_1\in\fK^2, \bm{k}_1\neq \vzero}\exp\left(-\frac{\Norm{\vk_1}^2}{4\alpha}\right)\Bigg|\Bigg|\nabla_{\bm{r}_i}\phi(\vk_1)\\
        &~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-\frac{1}{H} \sum_{\bm{k}_2\in\fK^2, \bm{k}_2\neq \vzero}\nabla_{\bm{r}_i}\phi(\vk_2)\exp\left(-\frac{\Norm{\vk_2}^2}{4\alpha}\right)\Bigg|\Bigg|^2\;.
\end{align*}
\end{prop}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Furthermore, under the Debye-H$\ddot{\text{u}}$ckel approximation~\cite{levin2002electrostatic}, we have  the following~Lemma~\ref{lem::upper_bound_phiRB}, whose proof can be found in Appendix G in~\cite{gan2024fast}.
\begin{lem} \label{lem::upper_bound_phiRB}
  Under the assumption of the DH theory, given function of the form 
    \begin{equation}
       \mathscr{G}(\V{r}_i)=\sum_{j\neq i}q _i q_{j}\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}f(z_{ij}),
    \end{equation}
 where $\abs{f(z_{ij})}$ is bounded by  a constant $C_f$ independent of $z_{ij}$, then function $ \mathscr{G}(\V{r}_i)$ is bounded above by
    \begin{equation}
         \mathscr{G}(\V{r}_i)\leq q_i  C_f\lambda_{\mrm{D}}^2\;,
    \end{equation}
    where~$\lambda_{\mrm{D}}$  represents the Debye length.
	% Under the assumption of the DH theory, $|\phi(\bm{k})|$ and $\Norm{\nabla_{\bm{r}_i}\phi(\bm{k})}$ have their respective upper bounds
	% \begin{equation}
	% 	\abs{ \widetilde{\varphi}^{\emph{RB}}(\bm{k})}\leq\frac{2\sqrt{\pi}\lambda_D^2 Q}{L_xL_y k}\left(\sqrt{\pi}+\frac{\alpha \varepsilon}{k}\right),
	% 	\quad
	% 	\abs{\nabla_{\bm{r}_{i}} \widetilde{\varphi}^{\emph{RB}}(\bm{k})}\leq  \frac{\pi \lambda_D^2 q_{i}^2}{L_xL_y}\left[3+\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{\pi}}\left(1+\frac{2\sqrt{2}\varepsilon}{k}\right)\right], 
	% \end{equation}
	% where $\lambda_{D}$ represents the Debye length
\end{lem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Finally, we introduce the following Theorem~\ref{thm:unbaised} for the boundedness and convergence in the fluctuations originated from the random batch approximation.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{thm}\label{thm:unbaised}
	Under the assumption of the DH theory,   the variance  of the estimators of   forces have closed upper bounds
	\begin{equation}
		  \mathbb{E}\Norm{\V{\chi}_{i}}^2\leq\frac{ H^2q_i^2\lambda_{\mrm{D}}^4}{2P\epsilon_{\mrm{c}}^2 L_x^2L_y^2}\left( \frac{1+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{u}}}+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{d}}}+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}}}{1-\max\{0,\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\}}\right)^2\;,
	\end{equation}
     where~$\lambda_{\mrm{D}}$  represents the Debye length.
\end{thm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{proof}
We observe that 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
 \nabla_{\bm{r}_i}\phi(\vk)&=   \sum_{q=1}^4 \nabla_{\bm{r}_i}\left\{S_q(\vk)\right\}h_q(\vk)\;,
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
thus we have,
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{align*}
%  \nabla_{\bm{r}_i} S_q(\vk)&= \begin{pmatrix} \nabla_{\vrho_i}S_q(\vk)\\
% \partial_{z_i}S_q(\vk) \end{pmatrix}   = \begin{pmatrix} \mathrm{i} \V{k}S_q(\vk)\\
% \pm k S_q(\vk) \end{pmatrix} =\begin{pmatrix} \mathrm{i} \V{k} \\
% \pm k  \end{pmatrix}S_q(\vk)\;,
% \end{align*}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
 \nabla_{\bm{r}_i} S_1(\vk)&=\sum_{j,j\neq i}q_iq_j   \begin{pmatrix} \mathrm{i} \V{k} \\
 \pm k  \end{pmatrix}\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(-k\Abs{z_i-z_j})\;,\\
 \nabla_{\bm{r}_i} S_2(\vk)&=\sum_{j,j\neq i}q_iq_j   \begin{pmatrix} \mathrm{i} \V{k} \\
 -k  \end{pmatrix}\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(-k(z_i+z_j))\;,\\
  \nabla_{\bm{r}_i} S_3(\vk)&=\sum_{j,j\neq i}q_iq_j   \begin{pmatrix} \mathrm{i} \V{k} \\
 k  \end{pmatrix}\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(k(z_i+z_j))\;,\\
 \nabla_{\bm{r}_i} S_4(\vk)&=\sum_{j,j\neq i}q_iq_j   \begin{pmatrix} \mathrm{i} \V{k} \\
 \pm k  \end{pmatrix}\exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})}\exp(k\Abs{z_i-z_j})\;,\\
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and  the choice of $+$ or $-$ depends on the choice of particle. Consequently, $\grad_{\V{r}_i} \phi(\V{k})$ takes the form
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
  \grad_{\V{r}_i} \phi(\V{k})  &=\sum_{j,j\neq i}q_iq_j  \exp{(\mathrm{i} \V{k} \cdot \V{\rho}_{ij})} \begin{pmatrix} \mathrm{i} \V{k} \\
 \pm k  \end{pmatrix}g(z_{ij})\;,
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where the estimates on $g(z_{ij})$ reads
\begin{align*}
  \Abs{g(z_{ij})  }&\leq  \frac{1+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{u}}}+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{d}}}+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}}}{4\epsilon_{\mrm{c}} L_xL_y k\left(1-\max\{0,\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\}\right)}\;,
\end{align*}
on the basis of Lemma \ref{lem::upper_bound_phiRB}, the upper bound of~$\abs{\grad_{\V{r}_i} \phi(\V{k})}$ can be estimated as follows 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
  \Norm{\nabla_{\bm{r}_i}\phi(\vk)}\leq \frac{q_i\lambda_{\mrm{D}}^2}{2\epsilon_{\mrm{c}} L_xL_y}    \frac{1+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{u}}}+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{d}}}+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}}}{1-\max\{0,\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\}}\;.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Finally,  variance of force on the $i$-th particle is bounded above by
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
   	\mathbb{E}\Norm{\V{\chi}_{i}}^2&\leq   \frac{2H}{P}\sum_{\bm{k}_1\in\fK^2, \bm{k}_1\neq \vzero}\exp\left(-\frac{\Norm{\vk_1}^2}{4\alpha}\right)\Norm{\nabla_{\bm{r}_i}\phi(\vk_1)}^2\\
    &\leq  \frac{2H^2}{P}\left(\frac{q_i\lambda_{\mrm{D}}^2}{2\epsilon_{\mrm{c}} L_xL_y}    \frac{1+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{u}}}+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{d}}}+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}}}{1-\max\{0,\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\}}\right)^2\\
    &= \frac{ H^2q_i^2\lambda_{\mrm{D}}^4}{2P\epsilon_{\mrm{c}}^2 L_x^2L_y^2}\left( \frac{1+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{u}}}+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{d}}}+\Abs{\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}}}{1-\max\{0,\gamma_{\mrm{u}}\gamma_{\mrm{d}}\}}\right)^2\;.
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\end{proof}
We remark that $H\sim L_xL_y$, then $	\mathbb{E}\Norm{\V{\chi}_{i}}^2=\fO\left(\frac{1}{P}\right)$ and independent of the particle number $N$.
Theorem~\ref{thm:unbaised} has demonstrated that the variance of force scales as $\fO\left(\frac{1}{P}\right)$, unaffected by the growth of the system size $N$, provided the same   Debye length $\lambda_{\mrm{D}}$. 
This is crucial for its practical usage in MD simulations, where the dynamical evolution typically relies on force calculations rather than energy. 
We proceed to demonstrate  
%some analysis for the strong convergence of the random batch MD, which further supports this observation. The following result indicates 
that random mini-batch methods can be valid for capturing the finite time dynamics
(we take the Langevin thermostat for illustration). Before that, we shall introduce  some additional notations.
Let $\Delta t$ be the discretized time step, and $\bm{r}_i$, $m_i$, and $\bm{p}_i$ represent the position, mass, and momentum of the $i$th particle, respectively. 
\begin{thm}(Strong convergence)
Let $(\bm{r}_i, \bm{v}_i)$ be the solutions to
\[
\begin{split}
&\D\bm{r}_i=\bm{v}_i\,\D t\;,\\
&m_i \D\bm{v}_i=\left[\bm{F}_i-\gamma \bm{v}_i\right]\,\D t+\sqrt{\frac{2\gamma}{\beta}}\D \bm{W}_i\;,
\end{split}
\]
where $\{\bm{W}_i\}_{i=1}^N$ are i.i.d. Wiener processes. Let $(\widetilde{\bm{r}}_i, \widetilde{\bm{v}}_i)$ be the solutions to
\[
\begin{split}
&\D \widetilde{\bm{r}}_i=\widetilde{\bm{v}}_i\,\D t\;,\\
&m_i \D\widetilde{\bm{v}}_i=\left[\bm{F}_i +\bm{\chi}_i-\gamma \widetilde{\bm{v}}_i\right]\,\D t+\sqrt{\frac{2\gamma}{\beta}}\D \bm{W}_i\;,
\end{split}
\]
with the same initial values as $(\bm{r}_i, \bm{v}_i)$. Suppose that the masses $m_i$'s are bounded uniformly from above and below.
If the forces $\bm{F}_i$ are bounded and Lipschitz and $\Exp \bm{\chi}_i=0$, then for any $T>0$, there exists $C(T)>0$ such that
\[
\Exp\left[\frac{1}{N}\sum_i (\Norm{\bm{r}_i-\widetilde{\bm{r}}_i}^2
+\Norm{\bm{v}_i-\widetilde{\bm{v}}_i}^2) \right] \leq C(T)\sqrt{\Lambda \Delta t}\;,
\]
where $\Lambda$ is an upper bound for $\max_i  \Exp\Norm{\bm{\chi}_i}^2$.
\end{thm}
Similar proofs for interacting particle systems can be found in \cite{jin2020convergence,li2019stochastic,li2020random}, and we omit the proof for the claims here.  Due to the assumption that $\bm{F}_i$ is bounded and Lipschitz, the claims above are not helpful for our problem. Anyhow, it can give us some insight how random batch type methods work.

\section{Numerical Results}
\label{sec:result}

In this section, we validate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method by applying it to several typical scientific problems, some the results are compared with that of the previously proposed method, such as the Ewald2D method, the image charge method and the HSMA method.
The runtime of QEM in one of the typical scenario is also tested.
These examples indicate that the proposed method is effective and efficient.
All calculations are performed in a Ubuntu system with AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3995WX@2.2GHz, 1 CPU core.
Our software~\cite{QuasiEwald} is developed based on the Julia Programming Language~\cite{Julia-2017} and the open-source package \emph{CellListMap.jl}~\cite{celllistmap}.
The figures are generated by the open-source package \emph{Makie.jl}~\cite{DanischKrumbiegel2021}.

\subsection{Interaction between charges}

In this subsection, we validate the accuracy and convergence of our method by calculating the electrostatic interaction energy and force between charged particles distributed in quasi-2D systems.
It is remarked that the importance sampling technique is not applied here.

We first consider the electrostatic interaction between a pair of negatively charged particles, and the results are compared with that of the ICM.
We focused on two simple situations,~$\gamma_{d} = \gamma_{u} = \gamma = \pm 0.95$.
Size of the simulation box is set as~$(100, 100, 50)$, and the particle with charge~$+1$ is fixed at~$(50, 50, 1)$, while the other one with charge~$-1$ is moved along the $x$ axis or the $z$ axis.
For Quasi-Ewald method, we apply Eq.~\eqref{eq:energy} and set~$\alpha = 1.0$,~$n = 50$ and~$E = 4$; for ICM, we use Eq.~\eqref{eq:ICM} directly and the number of periodic images in $xy$ and reflected images in $z$ are set as~$(200, 200, 40)$.
The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:E_xyz}, which indicates that QEM can accurately calculate the effects of the dielectric interface.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{figs/E_xyz.pdf}
    \caption{
        Electric field in (a) $x$ and (b) $z$ between a pair of negatively charged particles, which are confined in a box with size of $(100, 100, 50)$.
        One of the particle is located at $(50, 50, 1)$, and the other one is located at (a) $(50 + \Delta x, 50, 1)$ and (b) $(50, 50, \Delta z)$.
        The lines are results by QEM and the dots are results by the ICM with direct lattice sum.
    }
    \label{fig:E_xyz}
\end{figure}

Then to validate the convergence of the Quasi-Ewald method, we calculate the interaction energy of a system containing~$100$ randomly distributed particles using QEM, comparing to that of the Ewald2D method and the ICM.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:Error_E}, the relative error of the interaction energy is plotted as function of the parameter~$E$ and the reflection rate~$\gamma$.
The results show that as $E$ increases, the relative error decreases rapidly, demonstrating the convergence of QEM.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.625\linewidth]{figs/e_total.pdf}
    \caption{
        Relative error of the energy of $100$ charged particles randomly distributed in a box with size of~$(100, 100, 50)$, as functions of the parameter~$E$ and reflection rates~$\gamma$.
    }
    \label{fig:Error_E}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Applications in MD Simulations}

To demonstrate the accuracy of the Quasi-Ewald method for planar dielectric interfaces in a MD simulation, we study a few electrolytes modeled as the restricted primitive model, confined between two dielectric interfaces.
In all simulations, the box size is set as $(100 \tau_0, 100\tau_0, L_z)$, and consists of 436 particles immersed in continuum solvent characterized by a Bjerrum length $\ell_{\mathrm B} = e_0^2/(4 \pi \eps_2 k_B T) = 3.5 \tau_0$, where~$e_0$ is the unit of smallest charge.
The ions are modeled as soft spheres of diameter~$\tau_0$ that have an excluded-volume interaction represented by a purely repulsive shifted-truncated Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential with energy scale~$\eps_{LJ} = k_B T$, where~$k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and~$T$ is the absolute temperature.
The ions are confined by purely repulsive shifted-trunacted LJ walls ($\eps_\text{ion-wall} = k_B T$; $\tau_\text{ion-wall} = 0.5 \tau_0$) at $z = 0$ and $z = L_z$. 
The MD simulations is utilize a time step $0.001 t_0$, where $t_0 = \tau_0 m_0 / k_B T$ is the unit of time with $m_0 = 1$~(LJ unit), the ion mass, and temperature is controlled via Nosé–Hoover thermostat.
When evaluating the electrostatic interaction using the Quasi-Ewald method, we set~$E = 4$,~$p = 30$ and~$n = 40$.
In all simulations, it takes~$2 \times 10^6$ time steps to reach equilibrium, after which we continue the simulation for $3 \times 10^6$ time steps for sampling.
We sample every 100 steps, which yields~$3 \times 10^{4}$ independent and equilibrated configurations.

\subsubsection{MD Simulations of Symmetric Systems}

We first study symmetric systems where the top and bottom substrates have the same permittivity, i.e.,~$\gamma_u = \gamma_d = \gamma = \pm 0.95$, and we take~$L_z = 50 \tau_0$.
The system contains 218 cations and 218 anions carrying charge~$\pm e_0$, respectively.
To validate, we compared the charged distribution of Quasi-Ewald method with result of the HSMA~\cite{liang2020harmonic}.
The ion density profiles by QEM and HSMA are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:MD}, which shows that distributions obtained by QEM and HSMA overlap within statistical accuracy. 
The expected ion accumulation near high-permittivity surfaces and ion depletion near insulating interfaces are borne out by the simulations, which demonstrates that our method can accurately reproduce the characteristics of the system's equilibrium state.
The mean square displacements (MSD) in $xy$ and in $z$ of the simulation processes are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:msd}.
The MSD in the periodic dimensions shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:msd}(a) is consistent with a normal diffusion process, where the~$O(t^2)$ and~$O(t)$ parts correspond to the short/long-time self diffusion, respectively.
Due to the confinements in~$z$, the MSD in the non-periodic dimension shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:msd}(b) behaves differently as a sub-diffusion process, where the MSD stop growing at long time, indicating the ions are confined by the dielectric interfaces.
The results here qualitatively agree well with that shown in previous experiments and simulations~\cite{das2010single, neusius2009subdiffusion}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.8 \linewidth]{figs/compare_HSMA.pdf}
    \caption{
        Distributions of ion density in~$z$ for symmetric electrolytes containing 218 cations and 218 anions and confined by neutral dielectric substrates with $\gamma_u = \gamma_d = \pm 0.95$ at~$z = 0$ and~$50\tau_0$, solid lines by Quasi-Ewald method (QEM) and dashed lines by HSMA.
    }
    \label{fig:MD}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 1.0 \linewidth]{figs/msd.pdf}
    \caption{
        The MSD of the ions in (a)~$xy$ and (b)~$z$, respectively, as functions of simulations time and reflection rates.
    }
    \label{fig:msd}
\end{figure}

Then CPU time for the Quasi-Ewald method to compute the interactions between~$N$ particles is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:timecost}, where cost of the Ewald2D method is also shown as reference.
The particle number surface density is fixed as~$4.36 \times 10^{-2} \tau_0^{-2}$ and thickness of the system is fixed to be~$50 \tau_0$, which are the same to the simulations above.
The number of charged particles is increased from~$10^2$ to~$10^5$.
For QEM, the same parameter as the previous simulations are applied; for Ewald2D method, parameter are selected so that the results are of 4-digit precision.
The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:timecost}, which indicate that complexity of QEM is of~$\mathcal{O}(N)$.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.625\linewidth]{figs/runtime.pdf}
    \caption{
    CPU time of computing the interactions between all particles for different particle quantities under the condition of the same particle number surface density.
    The blue and red dots corresponding CPU time of Ewald2D method and Quasi-Ewald method, and the dashed lines are fitted with slopes of~$2$ and~$1$, respectively.
    }
    \label{fig:timecost}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{MD simulations of asymmetric systems}
As been mentioned above, Quasi-Ewald method can be used to simulate asymmetric thin systems.
We consider two cases with asymmetry in dielectric mismatches and cation/anion valences.
In both cases, the thickness of the system is set as~$L_z = 10 \tau_0$, so that ~$L_{x/y} / L_z = 10$.

\textbf{Case I: Asymmetry in dielectric mismatches.}
In this case, we study the effect of the asymmetric dielectric mismatches.
The dielectric confinements are set as $\gamma_d = -0.95$ and~$\gamma_u = 0.95$, and the system contains 218 cations and 218 anions carrying charge~$\pm e_0$, respectively.
We keep other parameters the same as that of the previous example.

The spatial distribution of ions in~$z$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:non_sym}.
Both cations and anions are attracted towards the lower dielectric plate with a negative reflection coefficient, while being repelled by the upper dielectric plate with a positive dielectric coefficient, thereby forming an strongly asymmetric spatial distribution as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:non_sym}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.625\linewidth]{figs/non_symm.pdf}
    \caption{
        Ion density in~$z$ for symmetric electrolytes containing 218 cations and 218 anions and confined by neutral dielectric substrates with $\gamma_u = 0.95$,~$\gamma_d = -0.95$ at~$z = 0$ and~$10\tau_0$.
    }
    \label{fig:non_sym}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Case II: Asymmetry in cation/anion valences.}
Another application is the simulation of charge asymmetric systems.
In that simulation, we keep~$\gamma_u$ and $\gamma_d$ the same and equals to~$\gamma = \pm 0.95$, but simulate a $3:1$ salt with $109$ trivalent cations and $327$ monovalent anions. 
The other parameters are kept the same as above.

The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:salt3-1}, which shows that the ion distributions are highly concentrated around the center or near the substrates.
For cations, due to the increase in the charge of the cations, the repulsive/attractive effects on both sides of the medium are significantly enhanced when~$\gamma$ greater or smaller than~$0$, respectively.
The anions are influenced by the distribution of cations, exhibiting characteristics of aggregation towards the center/sides, which are consistent with expectations.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{figs/density_3-1.pdf}

  \caption{
    Cation and anion density in~$z$ for a $3:1$ salt with $109$ trivalent cations and $327$ monovalent anions confined by neutral dielectric substrates with (a) $\gamma_u = \gamma_d = \gamma = - 0.95$ and (b) $\gamma_u = \gamma_d = \gamma = 0.95$.
    Red and blue lines are for cations and anions, respectively.
  }
    \label{fig:salt3-1}
\end{figure}

These cases indicates that Quasi-Ewald method can also provide significant advantages in handling systems with particle asymmetry, thinness, and strong polarization effects.

\section{Broken Symmetry in Quasi-2D Coulomb Systems}

\subsection{Extension to system with negatively dielectric confinements}

\subsection{Oscillatory single particle field}

The dielectric confinement effect turns out to be physically fascinating even in the presence of a single charged particle. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:force_x} (a), we present the electric field in the $x$ direction generated by a cation with valence~$\nu=1$ located at~$(x_0, y_0, \tau_0)$ in a quasi-2D system with a thickness of~$10\tau_0$, as a function of the distance from the cation~$\Delta x=x-x_0$, for different reflection rates~$\gamma$ characterizing the confinement. 
The field is defined as~$-\nu\ell_B\partial_x G(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r_0})$, where~$G(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r_0})$ is given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:G_pv}, and~$\ell_B=e_0^2/(4\pi\epsilon_0\epsilon k_B T)$ is the Bjerrum length of the solvent, with~$e_0$ the elementary charge,~$\epsilon_0$ the vacuum permittivity,~$k_B$ the Boltzmann constant, and~$T$ the temperature. 
For~$\vert\gamma\vert<1$ cases, as illustrated by the blue ($\gamma=-0.95$) and orange ($\gamma=0.95$) lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:force_x} (a), the polarization weakens or enhances the bare Coulomb field ($\gamma=0$), but with no qualitative difference. 
The results obtained by our method are in good agreement with those obtained by ICM, shown in dots in Fig.~\ref{fig:force_x} (a). 
However, for~$\vert\gamma\vert>1$, the results become non-trivial and qualitatively different. 
At short distance ($\tau_0<\Delta x < 10\tau_0$), we observe from Fig.~\ref{fig:force_x}(a) a continuous transition in the the near field interaction from like-charge attraction (LCA) into repulsion as~$\gamma$ increases from $-10$ to $+10$,
which can be understood as a significant enhancement of the polarization effect for~$\abs{\gamma}<1$ cases.
Even more interesting is the far field, it no longer decays monotonically but exhibits oscillatory behavior, which is rarely reported in previous studies.

To understand the origin of field oscillations, the polarization charge density profile on the substrate at~$z=0$ is shown in the subplots of Fig.~\ref{fig:force_x} (a). 
The charge density is defined by 
\begin{equation}
    \sigma(\V{r}) = \lim_{z \to 0^+} \nu \ell_B \eps_0  \left( 1 - \frac{\eps}{\eps'} \right) \partial_z G(\V{r}, \V{r_0})\;,
\end{equation}
and the field lines generated by $\sigma(\V r)$ are sketched in Fig.~\ref{fig:force_x} (b). 
The field oscillation is found to be generated by the strong transverse polarization charge density waves, influencing both the near and far fields. 
The oscillatory field lines has a very similar structure to that of a surface plasmonic resonance wave~\cite{willets2007localized}, but the physical origin is different. 
The oscillation is due to the reflected polarization enhanced by the dielectric confinement, characterized by parameters~$\gamma_1$,~$\gamma_2$, and~$L_z$. Particularly,
The confinement induced oscillation wave number is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:k0}
    k_0 = \frac{\ln{\gamma_1 \gamma_2}}{2 L_z}\;,
\end{equation}
which we will show analytically that this corresponds to a first-order pole in the Sommerfeld integral representation of the Green's function.
And the wavelength of the oscillation, defined as two times the distance between nearby zeros, satisfies 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wavelength}
    \lambda \cdot k_0 = 2 \pi \;.
\end{equation}
Numerical validation shows that Eq.~\eqref{eq:wavelength} is highly robust under different choices of~$\V{r}$,~$\V{r}_0$,~$\gamma$, or~$L_z$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:k_wavelegth}.
Importantly, the oscillation fields can be accurately predicted and controlled by adjusting~$k_0$. 
Eq.~\eqref{eq:k0} also indicates that the oscillation shall be weakened as $L_z$ is increased, and becomes non-oscillatory when $\gamma_1\gamma_2<1$.

\subsection{Theoretical origin for oscillations}

Eq.~\eqref{eq:G_point_charge} shows that the Green's function can be represented as a Sommerfeld integral, and the analytical form of $g(k, z, z_s)$ indicates that it has non-trival behaviors.
Clearly, $g(k, z, z_s)$ is divergent at $k=k_0$ (given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:k0}), and as $\gamma_1\gamma_2$ increases to be larger than 1, $k_0$ will shift onto the positive real axis, then the Sommerfeld integral needs to be renormalized.
Notice that when~$k \to k_0$, the divergent factor has the property
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\gamma_1 \gamma_2 \exp{(-2 k L_z)} - 1} \to \frac{1}{2 L_z (k_0 - k)}\;,
\end{equation}
so that~$k_0$ is a first-order pole and the Cauchy principal value exists.
Then Eq.~\eqref{eq:G_point_charge} for~$\gamma_1 \gamma_2 > 1$ cases is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:G_pv}
    G(\V{r}, \V{s}) = - \text{p.v.} \left[ \int_{0}^{+\infty} 2 g(k, z, z_s) J_0(k \Delta \rho) k \text{d}k \right]  \;,
\end{equation}
which can be calculated numerically. In what follows, we analyze the oscillatory behavior~(for more details, see Supplementary Information (SI)~\cite{SI}). First, the Green's function consists of integrals of the following general form
\begin{equation}
    I_o = \int_0^{\infty} \frac{J_0(k \D \rho) \text{e}^{-ka}}{\exp{\left( 2 L_z (k_0 - k) \right)} - 1} \text{d}k\;,
\end{equation}
where~$\D \rho$,~$k_0$ and~$a$ are all positive constants.
We find that~$I_o$ can be further expanded as
\begin{equation}
    I_{o} = \frac{e^{-k_0 a}}{2L_z} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{J_0(k^\prime)}{k_0 \D \rho - k^\prime} \text{d}k^\prime + f(k_0, \D \rho, a),
\end{equation}
where~$k^\prime = k \D \rho$, and~$f(k_0, \D \rho, a)$ is a non-oscillatory analytic function which has minor contribution to~$I_o$.
The first integral term can be understood as a function of~$k_0 \D \rho$, or denoted as~$I_{m} (k_0 \D \rho)$. Clearly, $I_{m}$ is solely controlled by~$k_0$, given different parameters of $\gamma$ and $L_z$.
It is found that the first-order pole in $I_{m}$ provides the oscillatory mode, and we also numerical validated that the wavelength of the oscillation in $I_{m}$ indeed satisfies Eq.~\eqref{eq:wavelength}, which explains our findings.

\subsection{Spontaneous symmetry breaking in confined Coulomb systems}

To investigate the influence of dielectric nanoconfinement on the collective behavior of quasi-2D charged systems, we further developed a collection of numerical techniques to efficiently evaluate the Green's function Eq.~\eqref{eq:G_point_charge}. A novel Ewald-splitting type strategy is proposed, together with renormalization techniques and fast convergent quadrature schemes. All fine details and numerical validations are provided in the SI~\cite{SI}.
Our study focuses on a prototypical quasi-2D charged system, consisting of a binary mixture of charged particles described by the primitive model.
The system comprises~$N/2$ cations and~$N/2$ anions, each with the same diameter~$\tau_0$ and valence~$\pm 1$, resulting in an overall charge-neutral system. 
The Hamiltonian of the system is defined as follows, where~$i$ represents the~$i$-th particle with charge~$q_i$ located at position~$\V{r_i}$:
\begin{equation}
   \mathcal H = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j=1}^{N}{}^\prime q_i q_j \ell_B G(\V r_i, \V r_j) + U_{\mathrm{LJ}}\;,\label{eq:Hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
The sum notation~$\sum_{i,j}{}^\prime$ implies that when~$i=j$, the function~$G(\V r, \V r)$ corresponds to the self-interaction term, and~$U_{\mathrm{LJ}}$ is the shift-truncated Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential energy used to model excluded-volume interactions. 
While this model disregards other important interactions observed in experimental realizations, it enables us to isolate the dielectric confinement effect. 
Similar systems have been studied recently in Refs.~\cite{dos2017simulations,liang2020harmonic,yuan2021particle}.

\end{figure}

In all the MD simulations, we maintain a constant box size in the~$xy$ plane of~$180\tau_0 \times 180\tau_0$, which is confirmed to eliminate boundary effects.
We vary the values of~$L_z$ and~$\gamma$ to adjust the wave number~$k_0$. 
The system contains~$300$ cations and~$300$ anions.
To isolate electrostatic effect, the reduced temperature $T_r$ is defined as~$T_r =k_{\mathrm B}T/\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Coul}}$, where~$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Coul}} = e_0^2/(4 \pi \eps (3.5 \tau_0))$ and we set~$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{LJ}} = k_B T$ for both particle-particle and particle-substrate interactions. 
We integrate the temporal evolution using the Velocity-Verlet algorithm and control the temperature using the Anderson thermostat with stochastic collision frequency~$\omega = 0.1$ and reduced temperature~$T_r = 1$.

In the $\abs{\gamma}\leq 1$ regime, extensive simulation works have been done recently~\cite{liang2020harmonic,yuan2021particle} and no SSB phenomenon has been found, i.e., the density distributions of cations $\rho_{+}(\V r)$ and anions $\rho_{-}(\V r)$  always maintain symmetries of the system, given by 1) \emph{cross symmetry} in the confined space: $\rho_{+}(\V r)=\rho_{-}(\V r)$, 2) \emph{longitudinal symmetry}: $\rho_{\pm}(x,y,z)=\rho_{\pm}(x,y,L_z-z)$, and 3) \emph{transverse symmetry}: $\rho_{\pm}(x,y,z)=\rho_{\pm}(x',y',z)$. 
Our simulations give symmetric results for  $\abs{\gamma}\leq 1$, consistent as previous investigations (details are documented in SI~\cite{SI}). 
In the following discussions we will focus on the strongly polarizable cases of $\abs{\gamma}>1$, where SSB phenomena arise.

Fig.~\ref{fig:MD}(a) shows two snapshots for particle distributions near the lower substrate and the corresponding induced surface charge densities, for $\gamma=\pm10$ and $L_z=10$. It clearly shows, for the first time, SSB phenomena in such dielectric confined charged system: both the cross and transverse symmetries are broken when $\gamma=10$; and the remaining longitudinal symmetry is further broken when $\gamma=-10$ (as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:MD}(b)).

Globally, we observe charged particles spontaneously forming square lattice structures near the substrates for both~$\gamma > 1$ and~$\gamma < -1$ cases, which breaks the transverse symmetry. 
We attribute this to the long-range single particle oscillatory field in the $xy$-plane, which directs particles self-organizing into a \emph{checkerboard} structure, so as to enhance the overall induced charge landscape, which helps confining particles in local potential wells.
Locally within each lattice site, two different particle structures are observed: for~$\gamma >1$, interfacial liquid phase is formed, while for~$\gamma < -1$, likely-charged particles self-assemble into 2D clusters, both can be understood by the near field behaviors due to a single confined particle, as was discussed and illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:force_x} (a).

Interestingly, in the longitudinal direction, we find that the interfacial liquids/clusters on opposing substrates are strongly correlated, i.e., there is a one-to-one “pairing” between the opposing particle structures, as show in Fig.~\ref{fig:MD}(b).
For $\gamma=10$, the longitudinal pairing is between symmetrically charged particles; while for $\gamma=-10$, the pairing becomes anti-symmetric, which further breaks the longitudinal symmetry. The symmetric/anti-symmetric longitudinal paring is due to the induced charge landscape on opposing substrates, it is clearly that for $\gamma=10$, the checkerboard structures would be matched symmetrically, while for $\gamma=-10$ a negative sign is added to the reflection rates, forming anti-symmetric pairs.

Finally, it is worth noting that the formed square lattices can be well-controlled via the single parameter~$k_0$, consistent with our theoretical prediction.
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:MD}(c), the lattice constant of the system is found to be proportional to $k_0^{-1}$, with various choice of $L_z$ and $\gamma$. 
Two slightly different linear relationships are observed, with fitted ratio~$1.2 \pi$ and~$1.4 \pi$ for~$\gamma < -1$ and~$\gamma > 1$ cases, respectively. 
The distance between neighboring clusters is found to be consistent with the second zero point of the induced surface charge density profile due to a single point charge (see subplots of Fig.~\ref{fig:force_x} (a)). The mechanism allows one to efficiently modulate the collective phase of dielectric confined systems.
